%iOS version controlling and its relation to the usage of the compiler (Xcode) and the acceptable command lines will be discussed:
%- The first change that is observed is the usage of the '.onChange' in the syntax.
%`.onChange' is the command line that has made us change the iOS 17 to iOS 16.4 for our built because the command is deprecated in iOS17.
% TeX commenting criterion for typing the commented section is used.
% Filtration and unique identificaiton (related to the objects present in the user interface) both can be directly completed through the '.onChange' command.
% The '.onChange' command is helpful in redefining the variables already used in the syntax and addition in the defined variable is also possible through the + symbol.
