%iOS version controlling and its relation to the usage of the compiler (Xcode) and the acceptable command lines will be discussed:
%- The first change that is observed is the usage of the '.onChange' in the syntax.
%`.onChange' is the command line that has made us change the iOS 17 to iOS 16.4 for our built because the command is deprecated in iOS17.
% TeX commenting criterion for typing the commented section is used.
% Filtration and unique identificaiton (related to the objects present in the user interface) both can be directly completed through the '.onChange' command.
% The '.onChange' command is helpful in redefining the variables already used in the syntax and the addition in the defined variable is also possible through the + symbol.

%The command 'init(coordinateRegion::interactionModes:showsUserLocation:userTrackingMode:)' and its bounded value (by the $ symbol in the argument) of the command 
% 'Map (coordinateRegion:$mapRegion) can be replaced by using the other Map initializers that take the 'MapContentBuilder' construct.
        %Further details
            %The file can be compiled and the installation instructions can be easily availed for the installation of the application.

                        %Consider the following syntax:\\

%struct ContentView: View {
 %       var body: some View {
  %          Map {
   %             Marker("San Francisco City Hall", coordinate: cityHallLocation)
    %                .tint(.orange)
     %           Marker("San Francisco Public Library", coordinate: publicLibraryLocation)
      %              .tint(.blue)
       %         Annotation("Diller Civic Center Playground", coordinate: playgroundLocation) {
        %            ZStack {
         %               RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 5)
          %                  .fill(Color.yellow)
           %             Text("üõù")
            %                .padding(5)
             %       }
              %  }
            %}
            %.mapControlVisibility(.hidden)
        %}
    %}

%Now consider the following syntax:

%struct ConcuMap: View {
    
 %   @State var mapRegion = MKCoordinateRegion(center: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: -37.617717, longitude: 144.717181),
  %                                            span: MKCoordinateSpan(latitudeDelta: 0.05, longitudeDelta: 0.05)
        %                                              
         %                                     
                                                                               
                                              
    %)
    %var body: some View {
     %   VStack {
      %      Image(systemName: "mappin")
       %         .imageScale(.large)
        %        .foregroundColor(.accentColor)
         %   Text("Maps")
          %      .foregroundColor(Color(red: 0.296, green: 0.571, blue: 0.406))
            
           %%%~~~ Map(coordinateRegion: $mapRegion)

%The command line 57 is discussed.



%The command line 57 must have been a different command line (not the same if the line numbers of GitHub are used). The continuation did not happen. One thing
%that is impressive about Github is its ability to identify the syntax of the most of the computer langugages.
%We like commenting sometimes.
